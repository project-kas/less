            <h2>L.S.S Methodology</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For a long time Lengut Community has experienced zero serious threats of
                security.
                The community has been able to maintain peace and order through the implementation of
                the L.S.S.L methodology which stands for Listen, Speak, Solve and Learn. This approach emphasizes
                the importance of open communication, active listening, and collaborative problem-solving.
                <br><br>
                As technology continues to evolve, Lengut Community remains committed to adapting and improving its
                security measures to ensure the safety and well-being of its members. Hence, the online presence of
                Lengut Community through this website aims to enhance communication, provide resources, and keep members
                informed about community events and initiatives.
